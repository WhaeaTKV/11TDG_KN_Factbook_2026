        This statement is incorrect.In fact,<u>the Tarāpunga is among the longest-living species of birds.</u> The average lifespan of adult birds is typically between 12.9 years (male) and 15.7 years (female),their potential lifespan is very long; some individuals on record have lived to 30 or even 32 years old.
