                The Katipō spider is the only venomous spider native to New Zealand.
                They are black and often have white markings on the side of their abdomen.
                Female adult Katipō spider have a recognisable red stripe down the
                middle of their abdomen and a venomous bite.
                Males and juveniles have a lot of white and lack the red stripe
                (as seen in image on right of male next to a female).

            Female katipō spiders have a venomous bite, but males do not. 
            While it is possible for a female to bite you, it's highly unlikely
            because of their shy nature and scarsity.
            In the unlikely case that you do get biten you will most likely get Latrodectism.
            symptoms of this include: 
            <ul>
                <li>extreme pain in the area surrounding the bite</li>
                <li>nausea</li>
                <li>stomach cramps</li>
                <li>vomiting</li>
                <li>high blood pressure</li>
            </ul>
            There have been no fatalities caused by a katipō bite recorded in the past century and
            there is an antivenom, so in the extremely unlikely case you do get bitten,
            you will almost definetly survive.

            Due to a steady population decline, katipō is now classified as absolutely 
            Protected under the Wildlife Act.
            There is a species of invasive spiders that look like katipō (as seen in image on right) but are actually very harmful.
            These spiders are officially called black cobweb spiders but are also commonly 
            known as false Katipō due to their similar looks.

            katipō eggs are produced towards the end of the year. 
            The female produces 3-4 egg sacks, each containing up to 90 eggs.
            these egg sacks are then left in the open and the wind blows them 
            away to a different place where the spiders will grow up and repeat the cycle.

                Katipō spiders live in grasses, driftwood and sedges on sandy beaches throughout New Zealand.
                The furthest south katipō spiders live is on the coast of Otago.
