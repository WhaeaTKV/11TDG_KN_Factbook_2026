    <h1>Orca</h1>
    
    <p>The orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale It is called killer because ancient sailors discovered it and were shocked by the hunting methods of orcas. The largest member of the dolphin family and a highly intelligent top predator, it is distributed in all oceans. Unique body color: The back is mainly black, the abdomen is white, and it has distinct white eye spots. Orcas are widely distributed and inhabit various Marine environments from the Arctic to the Antarctic and tropical seas, but they are more common in temperate or colder coastal waters.
There are approximately 150 to 200 orcas living in New Zealand.
    Although orcas are top predators in the ocean, they are friendly to humans because humans are not on their diet.</p>
