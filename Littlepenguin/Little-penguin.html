<h2> Where do they live?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kororā live along all New Zealand coastlines, offshore islands, and in Southern Australia. Favoring rocky shores, sandy beaches, and dunes. </li>
<li>They nest in underground burrows, vegetation, or under man-made structures like sheds, and returning to land only at dusk.</li>
<li>Little penguins from New Zealand and Australia are called "Eudyptula minor." There are 2 two types: one containing little penguins of New Zealand's North Island, Cook Strait and Chatham Island, as well as the white-flippered penguin. And the second containing little penguiuns of Australia and Otago region of New Zealand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do they eat?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They are carnivores that hunt at sea, feeding primarily on small shoaling fish like sprats, anchovies, and sardines and squid, and crustaceans.</li>
    <li> They are pursuit divers,usually foraging 10-30m deep, though they can reach 70m. </li>
    <li>They can drink salt water and absorb nutrients from their diet</li>
    <li>The largest colonies are on Motunau Island (1650 nests), Pohatu Bay, Banks Peninsula (1250 pairs), and at the Oamaru Blue Penguin colony (>1,000 individuals).

<h3> Behaviour and ecology</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Little penguins are nocturnal on land</li>
    <li>They return to nesting areas at dusk,congregating in small groups, or "rafts" offshore. Rafts usually come ashore together and are comprised of the same individuals each night.</li>
    <li> They feed at sea as solitary individuals or small groups, with groups rarely containing more than 6 individuals.</li>
    <li> They must stay ashore continuously for about 2 weeks during the annual moult (mainly between January and March), when all feathers are replaced simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Fun Facts</h3>

<ul>
    <li> They use their paddle-like flippers to fly through the water at speed up to 6km/h.</li>
    <li>They have roughly 10,000 blue and white feathers which three to four times more than most birds that fly</li>
    <li>Their slate blue backs help them blend in with the ocean from above,while white bellies hide them from preditors below.</li>
    <li> They can dive as deep as 70m to hunt for squid and small fishes</li>
    <li>They are nocturnal on land, returning to their burrows at dusk to avoid predators, and spend their days at sea</li>
    <li>Kororā  can recognize each other's faces and voices, and some research suggests they can recognize humans.</li>
    <li> According to local legend in Russell, the name Kororā came from a Maori chief who,upon testing penguin soup, exclaimed "Ka reka te korora!"("how sweet/tasty is the penguin").</li>
    <li> They are the only penguins that can fly long distances in the air to migrate.</li>
