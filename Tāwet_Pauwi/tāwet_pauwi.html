<p>
    The Tāwet Pauwi is an average sized sea bird most often found in the Bay Of Plenty or Hauraki Gulf.
   <br>
    They nest offshore islands all round the North Island and, like the NZ Shag stick around fishing boats
   <br>
    and eat their scraps. They are dark brown with tube noses and broad wings, and their calls are said to 
   <br>
    resemble a cat fight. There nesting sites are mainly clear of any predators, but they are often accidentaly 
   <br>
    caught by commercial fishers leaving there numbers at less than 12,000 pairs.

    The Tāwet Pauwi is a species of shearwater (a kind of seabird), and there is some evidence that shearwaters
   <br>
    have a symbiotic relationship with the Tuatara. Although it is not confirmed some scientists believe that
   <br>
    Tuatara and these seabirds will share a burrow, and while the seabirds leave the nest the Tuatara will
   <br>
    protect the eggs from any insects that may come and invade the nest, at the same time getting a meal out of 
   <br>
    the insects. Although this symbiotic relationship has not yet been confirmed, researchers A. J. GASTON and 
    <br>
    P. SCOFIELIY published a paper saying that the seabird and Tuatara populations on North Brother Islad in the  
   <br>
    Cook Strait do in fact coexist, often living in the same burrows
